## Background

Looking at the Citi Bike website [New York Citi Bike Website](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), I decided to only use Citi Bike data in 2019. There were 12 csv files for each month, so I used jupyter notebook to concatenate each csv into a single csv ![here](2019/2019_concat_test.csv). The data did not require any further clean-up. From there, I used Tableau to create 5 visualizations, 2 dashboards, 1 geomap dashboard and 1 story.
